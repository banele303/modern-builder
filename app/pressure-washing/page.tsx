      question: "How often should I have my house or driveway cleaned?",
      answer: "The frequency of cleaning depends on factors like the type of surface, surrounding environment, and local climate. We generally recommend having your driveway or house exterior cleaned once a year. However, if you notice significant buildup of dirt, moss, or algae, it might be beneficial to schedule a cleaning sooner."
    },
    {
      question: "Is your cleaning process safe for all types of driveways and paving?",
      answer: "Yes, our cleaning process is safe for various types of driveways and paving, including concrete, pavers, asphalt, and brick. We use specialized equipment and eco-friendly solutions that are tough on grime but gentle on your surfaces. Our team is trained to clean different surface materials safely and effectively."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical driveway or house wash take?",
      answer: "The duration of a driveway or house washing job depends on the size and condition of the area. On average, a standard residential driveway cleaning takes 1-2 hours, while a house wash may take a bit longer. For larger areas or those with heavy buildup, it may take additional time. We'll provide you with a time estimate before starting the job."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer any guarantees on your work?",
      answer: "Yes, we stand behind the quality of our work. We offer a satisfaction guarantee on all our services. If you're not completely satisfied with the results, we'll return to address any issues at no additional cost. We also provide a 6-month guarantee against the regrowth of moss and algae on paved surfaces."
